while and dowhile loop

while loop: this loop is called as indeifinite loop.
this loop will not have any self increment factor as how a for loop have

user must write a failing condition, to exit out of the loop.

how does a while loop execute?

1.while loop will check the condition at the first step.
2.if the condition is true, then only the body will get executed.
3.inside the body once your logic complted, we must write the failing condition.

syntax:

while(some condition){
//body logic
// failing condition
}


DoWhileLoop:
this loop will get executed as same as whileloop.

the only difference is, this do while loop will not check for the condition for the first time.
here the logic will execute atleast once
one the logic inside the loop is completed, then only it will check for the condition.

syntax:

do{
//body
}while(condition);
