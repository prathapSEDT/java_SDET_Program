How to identify the modules as a package?

first analayse the flow of your application where it is getting started.

in a web application each page or screen will be consider as one module

while we design behaviours(methods), we consider each one of the functionality on the screen as on method.

Ex:

PageName== Login

ClassName===Login

Behaviours==login,forgetPassword,RestPassword,RememberPassword

PageName=== Register
ClassName==Register
Behaviours---- RegisterNewUSer,EditUser,DeleteUser



Now when we are writting behaviour for the application, we consider it as Application Utilities


Definetly there will be some methods which are not part of the application
Ex: createOutPutFolder,CreateResultFolder,SendEmail,DeleteFiles,MoveFiles etc......

these type of methods are called GenericMEthods which will be used only on the framework level.


now all teh application modules will depend on the Generic methods

all the testcases will depend on Applicationutils
