Regular Expression in java:

Regex is the process of retriving and validating data on a string using pattern.

User must need to define pattern, if this pattern is available on the source string, then the compiler will try to get the data from the source string.

if ther is no matching pattern available, then compiler will never try to retive the data.

The regex is coming from tehh pacakge called 
java.util.regex

what does this package contains?

There are two major class available

	* Pattern class
	* Matcher class

Steps:

1.first understand how to create a pattern for the data that you are looking on the source.
2.Using the pattern class, call the method called "compile()", this method will return a pattern object
3.Use matcher class, to validate that if the pattern object which was created on the step 2 is availableon the source string string or not, by using a method called find()

internally this findmethod is iterator.

why it is iterator?

Generally when the user written is exist more than one form.

say supose i wnat to validate email id avilable on the source, 

i wrote my pattern to validate my email id and also to retrive the email id.

But here i 0-9]found that there 5 matches availble

to get the data from the findmethod(), use the method called group()

group()--only one match
group(1)--- first occurance
group(2)--- second



all you want to understand here, the basic logic is derving from the pattern.

one should know how to write a strong pattern.

how to start writting pattern?
1.character set

in the regular usage we definetly go through the following

A-Z, a-z,0-9

to represent the character set, use []

[A-Z][a-z][0-9]-- representing in this way called and representation
[A-Za-z0-9]--- Or condition


ex:
My Pan Card Number is JHGNL7410E

from this string i want to extract my pan number

observe how the data is looking like.

ther are 5 capitals letters
4 numeics
ending with a capital

[A-Z][0-9][A-Z]

why i wrote like this? i dont know whose pan number is going come there.my regular expression should a strong pattern in order to validate any matching data.

2.Pairs ---{size}

how many characters do you want from the source string for writtern pattern

[A-Z]{5}[0-9]{4}[A-Z]{1}


3.how to include special characters on the pattern===\special characters

my date of birth is 08/09/1990

here we have special characters like "/"

now we need to retrive the DOB from the source string


4.i dont know how many characters will i be getting on a pattern to determine the size

for ex:
my email id is firstname.lastname@companyname.com

here i dont know how any chars will be available for firstname , lastname and company name


to solve this problem use *

* is used to include one or more chars  except a new line
[a-z]*\.[a-z]*\@[a-z]\.com



5.i have a string like

I placed an order, and i am acknowledged with the message as Transaction id             :785962 Generated

to include the spaces in the regex pattern,use \s
