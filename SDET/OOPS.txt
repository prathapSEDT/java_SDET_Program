I want to make my class to allow th e user to create an object only once, how can io do that?

Reasson when i create multiple object evry time  a memory refference will get created.

so that the performance will get degarded, to avoid it we use a concept called "single ton class"


single ton class will allow the user to create an object only once. 

how exactly a single ton class will look like?

1.all the variable will be of private type, when we make any class memebers to be as private, it can not accessed out side of your class

2.make the constructor to e a private, so that user will be restricted in creating an object

3.have a class object of type static

4..have a method called getInstance where you return the class object and ensure that this method is also a static method

onn the step 4, write a logic where you need to verify , if the class object is not null.



OOPS in java?

OOP stands for object oriented programing

OOPS is used write or create object that contais both mrthos and variables

oops have several advantages

	* faster and easy to exexute
	* provide crystal clear structure for the programs
	* It implements DRY prinicple

DRY----- Dont Repeat Your Self

it eans dont duplicate the code, analyse the reusability of the code and call whene ever it is required.

	* Main purpose of this oops concept is less code and more reusability



What are the major pillars of Java OOPS?

* class
* object
* methods
* Inheritance
* Polymorphisim
* Encapsulation
* Interfaces
* Abstarction

Inheritance:
it is process of acquiring the properties of parent class by a child class
parent class is called as "base class" child class is called deriveed class

to implement inheritance,we shoud use a keyword called as extends btwn parent and child


Syntax:

Class child extends parent{


}


when we create an object to child class, this child class object have capaicity to access the properties of the parent class
