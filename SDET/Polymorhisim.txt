To implement inheritance we need make the child class to get extends wit the parent class
key word extends is used to estlablish the relation between parent class and child class

steps:
===============

1.create a child class
2.use the extends keyword and make use of parent class
3.to test inheritance is applied, create an object to the child class, so that verify if you can see all teh methods and variable s from both the parent class and the child class

1.Single level inheritance
2.multiplevel
3.hierarchial
4.multiple inheritance
5.hybrid

4 and 5 is not possible in java

1,2,3 are possible


singel level inheritance:

one parent and only one child.

create a child class
create a parent class
extend the child class with the parent class
object created to the child class, will have tendency to get the properties of both parent an dchild


polymorphisim:
==========================
having ability to have more than one form  is called polymorphisim.

exmaple when i developed my framework, i started getting data from the excel workbook.,
latter i reliazed that getting data from a json is optimal.
but latter i found that most of the of the testcases are using excel as a datasource.

now if i modify the existing logic which was written in java excel code, all other testcases will get failed.

now with out changing the main method which was creted already we need to write a new logic with the same name

to do so, we use the concept of polymorphisim

* method overloading
* method overriding

method-overloading:
*************************

no inheritance required
same class
same method name
different parameters
may or may not be same access specifiers
may or may not be same having return type


method-overriding
*************************

inheritance required
different class
same method name
same parameters
higher to lower  access specifiers are allowed, no lower to higher
only subtypes are allowed to have a return types no others are allowed.

private method can not be override
static methods can not be override

on overiding use the annotation called 
@Override

this annotation will check wheter you implemented overriding principles correctly or not
