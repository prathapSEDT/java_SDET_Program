Static vs instance:

in java there are few rule applicable in understanding these two terms.


for all static memebers class will allocate memeory on creation or on while loading the class 

for all instance members, object will allocate memory.

object is called as instance of class.

creating of an object is called as "instantiation"

object have capacity to pull the members(variable and methods) of a class


so from today to access any static variable or methods we should access them by using, ClassName

When the members are going to be static variable, the data will be stored in the memory for long till the execution is completed.

for instance, if we create a new object , the old data will get vanish, beacuse whene ever we create an object an new memory allocation will be happen so that the variable data will get reinstalized.


Consume Other class variables and method in another class?

This concepts is more modularization.

it mean that when you are writting any logic , separate the modules and write the code

dont write all the logics in one palce so that it is easy to maintain the code and will have tarck on each module
