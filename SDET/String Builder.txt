String builder:

String builder is called as mutable

if the user try to modify the content of the source string, the actual data will get affected.

string builder is called as not thread safe.

String builder is As-synchronus


when you feel that, even if there is no problem is loosing data , then we can use your string builder

as it is async, performance is much greater, in the string builder.

String builder is a inbuilt class avialble in java


syntax:

StringBuilder builder=new String Builder();


now to create a string using string builder, user can pass the string as a input parameter to the string builder constructor.


Here constructor is new Builder();, though it is an object, constructor will get triggger on the object creation.

the other way of creating a string is using a method called append

user is not required to store the value inside a variable, because it will modify the actual content of the string

on the string builder by default , in the constructr there will be 16 chars space, when the user passes beyond 16 chars, aditional space will be allocated



String buffer: it is called as thread safe
it is sync process

when there is multiple threads created, one after tghe other will get access.

Use only string methods, try to print the out 
a-5
b-3
c-5

on the same string remove the duplicates


string 1="india is growing"

String 2="java is programming lanugae"

from string two, what ever the chars i got as unique, remove those unique charcter on the string 1


If the usier inputs a numberprint the even and odd numbers and also along with prime


1.what are the different ways to check the string is empty or not
2.what is the best way to check if the user given string is palindrome or not
3.Can is use switch case on the string
4.write a generic logic to check if string 1 is a subset of string 2
5.Give 5 major difference between myutable and immutable
6.String s1=null and string str=null, is this right representatin?
7.List out the difference between builder and buffer ?
8.Explain the concept of memeory sharing in the strings.
