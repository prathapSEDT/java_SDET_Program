Constructor:

Constructor is called as block of code which get exeucuted  as soon as when an object is created to the class.

By default there will be  no arg constructor created in the background.

This constructor works like a place holder to pass the data into a class.
This constrcutor will intialize the class level variables, if the variables are declared but not intialized, then this constructor will set to the default values.
Constructor can not return a value
Constructor name must be always as the name of the class.

syntax:

ClassName(){


}

The constructor might be a private , public, protected and default.


when the user create a constructor, the default constructor will be removed.


Constructor can be overloaded.

here overloaded means , with different args

when the class level variable and constrcutor level variables having same name available, the prefference is given to the constructor level variables

now to differentiate classlevel variables and local level variables, use the keyword called this.

this is a keyword which is used to represent the current class variables and methods



can i call a constructor from another constrcutor?
yes we can call another constructor from any constructor using a method called this(), by passing matching arguments

ensure that the calling statement this() is always a first statement inside the constructor.

Recursive is not possible in constructor



understand about static block and instancd block

static{}

{}

static block will called when we load a class
instance block will call when we create an object to the class
