What is debugging ?

debugging is the process of analysing the code line by line to verify if there are any issues available in the system.

it helps the user to understand what are values that are being stored by an variable in the run time.

to intiate the debug process , first user needs to insert a break point.

in the debug process we have three steps

1.stepover
to execute line by linein the code execution while performing debugging we use stepover

while doing debug , if we come across any method in between, to skip that particular method, but we need to execute the whole code available inside the method. we use stepover


2.StepInto:
stepinto is used to enter inside the method, while performing debug process we use stepinto

3.stepout:

this method is used to exit from any method while doing debugging on the code.
when you stepout from the method, it will execute the whole code and then it will get exit
